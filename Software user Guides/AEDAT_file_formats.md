Introduction
============

Files generated by inivation' event-based processing software, such as
cAER and jAER, use the custom AEDAT (=Address Event DATa) format to
store the event data and its timestamp information. Over the years this
format has evolved to address various needs, such as storing new data
types more efficiently or having larger timestamp ranges.

Version 1.0 has been supported since the first jAER release in 2008,
version 2.0 of the format is the most commonly found, as it was
supported by jAER and used as default since 2010. Version 3.0 came out
of research done with the cAER framework in 2015, and will soon be the
preferred format. Any new developments should be done with it in mind.
In April 2016, AEDAT 3.1 was specified as an update to the AEDAT 3.0
format, addressing a couple of shortcomings.

**X = Complete**

**X = In progress**

Common Version Header
=====================

AEDAT files have a common, human-readable header format.

A header was initially optional, but with the introduction of new format
revisions, it is now considered required, else it's impossible to parse
the file correctly.

If it exists, it is the first content present in a file, and is made up
of one or more header lines.

A header line begins with a '\#' character and ends with a CRLF (Windows
line ending, '\\r\\n').

Header lines, unless specified otherwise, are always case sensitive.

The very first header line contains information about the version of the
AEDAT format employed in the rest of the file. If it is not present,
version 1.0 is assumed.

The exact format of the version line is as follows:

> **\#!AER-DATx.y\\r\\n**

where x and y are the two version number components.

Other than the first version header line, no other header lines are
required or specified in a common way across all format versions, and
depend completely upon the software generating them. They should only be
used for informative uses, and not to store critical data or metadata,
unless specified as such below in one of the format versions explicitly.

AEDAT 1.0
=========

Version 1.0 of the AEDAT format was the first version to be implemented
in jAER back in 2008. It simply consists of an optional
[[header]{.underline}](#common-version-header), followed by a series of
\[address, timestamp\] pairs, each making up an event. The address is 16
bit wide and the timestamp 32 bit, for a total of 6 bytes per event. The
timestamp is in microseconds, while the address has to be interpreted
according to a specific jAER AEChip class' definition of that address.
All integer data and fields are always signed and big-endian!

**This format is deprecated and should not be used for any new
development or recording! At most, support reading this format.**

Ordering
--------

All events in the AEDAT 1.0 format are ordered by their timestamp, and
should guarantee timestamp monotonicity, meaning the next event will
always have an equal or greater timestamp.

It is possible to find older files where this was not guaranteed, due to
older hardware and its logic sometimes not ensuring that timestamp
increase events be always delivered. When this is the case, the jAER
software will detect this, warn the user and continue working by
"jumping back" to the new, but older, timestamp value.

DVS128
------

For version 1.0, this was usually the DVS128 chip class, which uses the
following format to store polarity (luminosity change) events generated
by the device:

  **Bits**   **Meaning**      **Description**
  ---------- ---------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  15         External event   External event detected on the IN pin (TS-Master mode).
  14-8       Y address        Y event address. (0, 0) in lower left corner of screen.
  7-1        X address        X event address. (0, 0) in lower left corner of screen.
  0          Polarity         Polarity (luminosity change): '1' means increase (ON), '0' means decrease (OFF).

AEDAT 2.0
=========

Version 2.0 was introduced in 2010. It is equivalent to version 1.0, but
widens the address field to 32 bit. It also requires the header version
line (see [[above]{.underline}](#common-version-header)), to be able to
disambiguate between formats. Then again an optional header, followed by
a series of \[address, timestamp\] pairs, each making up an event. The
address is 32 bit wide and the timestamp also 32 bit, for a total of 8
bytes per event. The timestamp is in microseconds, while the address has
to be interpreted according to a specific jAER AEChip class' definition
of that address. This could be the DVS128 class, same as
[[above]{.underline}](#dvs128), or the DAVIS family of classes
(DAVIS240A,B,C; DAVIS346cBSI, DAVIS640, ...). All integer data and
fields are always signed and big-endian!

The jAER software, since 2014, also writes several informative header
lines, these include the ***'HardwareInterface'*** and the
***'AEChip'*** header line, which contain information on the current
device and the class interpreting its output. Here is an example of
these informational lines:

> **\# This is a raw AE data file - do not edit**
>
> **\# Data format is int32 address, int32 timestamp (8 bytes total),
> repeated for each event**
>
> **\# Timestamps tick is 1 us**
>
> **\# created Thu Dec 03 14:47:00 CET 2015**
>
> **\# HardwareInterface: DAVIS FX3 0002-INI**
>
> **\# AEChip: eu.seebetter.ini.chips.davis.Davis640**

Further, a full XML-like dump of all the preferences for the above
AEChip class, which includes settings such as the APS exposure time or
the biases, is generated, and kept either fully in the header as header
lines, or, in the future, in a separate XML file, which is named
'***\<filename\>-prefs.xml***', and is referenced in the header as one
header line as follows:

**\# Prefs-File: *\<filename\>-prefs.xml*\\r\\n**

Entries looks like the following in XML (example is of an addressable
bias):

***\<entry key=\"DAVIS240C.AddressedIPotCF.ApsROSFBn.LowCurrent\"
value=\"false\"/\>***

Ordering
--------

All events in the AEDAT 2.0 format are ordered by their timestamp, and
should guarantee timestamp monotonicity, meaning the next event will
always have an equal or greater timestamp.

It is possible to find older files where this was not guaranteed, due to
older hardware and its logic sometimes not ensuring that timestamp
increase events be always delivered. When this is the case, the jAER
software will detect this, warn the user and continue working by
"jumping back" to the new, but older, timestamp value.

DAVIS
-----

The DAVIS camera family stores polarity (luminosity change) events, IMU
(Inertial Measurement Unit) samples and pixel intensity values (both APS
reset and signal read) according to the following scheme:

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| **Bits**              | **Meaning**           | **Description**       |

The following image explains the same thing in a more graphic way (IMU
data is not shown in this graphic, however):

height="1.375in"}

Frames, in this format, are laid out as a sequence of events, one for
each pixel. The timestamp for each pixel is also stored and corresponds
to the start of the readout of the column where the pixel resides. To
get start and end of frame and exposure timestamps, one has to look at
the timestamp of the pixel readouts closest to those moments:

-   Start of Frame: first reset read pixel.

-   Start of Exposure: last reset read pixel for GlobalShutter mode,
    > first reset read pixel for RollingShutter mode.

-   End of Exposure: first signal read pixel.

-   End of Frame: last signal read pixel.

Note that although the DAS1 has synchronisation ports, the insertion of
external trigger events into the event stream via a synchronisation
pulse has never been implemented in the firmware.

AEDAT 3
=======

The AEDAT 3 format was created as part of the cAER framework development
process in 2014 and further refined and version 3.0 finalized in 2015.

The different types of events our sensors produce nowadays, such as
frames or IMU events, have very different storage requirements, and
forcing them all into a \[32 bit address, 32 bit timestamp\] pair like
in [[version 2.0]{.underline}](#aedat-2.0) is highly inefficient. Also
having the interpretation of data depending on jAER's AEChip class, such
as for the polarity (luminosity change) events, or depending on external
header data, such as for the IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) event data
ranges, is very complex and error-prone.

The new format version 3 developed in response addresses these problems,
by choosing very efficient representations for each event type,
especially in terms of memory, and then bundling those together into
typed event packets. Further all data values have been expanded and
normalized, so that no further interpretation is needed: a DVS polarity
event will have its X and Y addresses in the same place, regardless of
which device produced it. In addition, an IMU event will have its
gyroscope data always in °/s (deg/s), without needing any further
conversions.

The AEDAT 3 format is currently at version 3.1. Version 3.1 is the first
revision of the AEDAT 3.X series, published in April 2016. It addresses
several issues that came up with the 3.0 format while it has been in
wider use with the cAER framework and several projects. This contains
mainly additions to the basic 3.0 format. The fullest and most recent
format is described here below. Then follows a section about earlier
versions of the format: [[3.0]{.underline}](#aedat-3.0).

AEDAT 3.1
=========

The file starts with several required header lines, as specified
[[here]{.underline}](#header-lines). The [[version header
line]{.underline}](#common-version-header) is always the first one,
followed by the 3.1 format header line, followed by any others.

After this is an optional
[[header]{.underline}](#common-version-header), followed by one initial,
optional configuration event packet, that holds all the initial device
configuration with a timestamp of zero (to guarantee monotonicity), and
then a series of typed event packets, which contain in turn all the
various events.

All integer data and fields are always signed and little-endian! This is
a departure from previous AEDAT formats, motivated by the fact all the
systems we support, currently x86(\_64) and ARM, are in fact native
little-endian systems, and doing so avoids unnecessary conversion
operations.

Header Lines
------------

-   Version header line (required): described
    > [[above]{.underline}](#common-version-header), always the first
    > header line. Specifically, the line is: '**\#!AER-DAT3.1\\r\\n**'

-   Format header line (required): follows right after the version line,
    > looking like this:

> **\#Format: \<FORMAT\>\\r\\n**
>
> The [[Format]{.underline}](#formats) header line describes how the
> event packets have to be interpreted later on, allowing for
> optimizations and extensions to be added as needed.
>
> Possible formats are: *[**[RAW]{.underline}**](#raw-id0x00)
> (default)*, [***[SerializedTS]{.underline}***](#serializedts-id0x01),
> [***[PNGFrames]{.underline}***](#pngframes-id0x02).

-   Source Identifier header line (required): human-readable identifiers
    > for all event source IDs present in the file are a mandatory part
    > of the header. The corresponding header line shall look like this:

> **\#Source \<ID\>: \<DESCRIPTION\>\\r\\n**
>
> If multiple sources are present, they must be placed in increasing
> order by numerical ID (0, 1, 2, 3, ...). The description part must be
> an element from the [[list of supported
> devices]{.underline}](#supported-devices). When re-logging or
> re-transmitting data, new source headers have to be created
> representing the new file or network source. The old source headers
> have to be preserved always, by adding a ***'-' (minus)*** sign in
> front of them.
>
> Example: **\#-Source 0: DVS128\\r\\n**

-   Start Time header line (required): this header line encodes the time
    > at which we started transmitting or logging data. The format is
    > the following:

**\#Start-Time: %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S (TZ%z)\\r\\n**

Time is encoded according to the C strftime() function, see '[[man
strftime]{.underline}](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strftime.3.html)'.

-   End of header line (required): follows right after all the other
    > header lines, looking like this:

> **\#!END-HEADER\\r\\n**
>
> This allows to clearly determine where the file header ends and data
> starts.

Event Packets
-------------

Each event packet is made up of a common header, followed by its
specific event data.

This is not the same header as above, which is placed at the start of a
file!

This header is specific to each and every event packet.

### Header

The common header has a constant size of 28 bytes and the following
format:

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

|                       |                       | table).               |

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

By multiplying ***eventCapacity*** with ***eventSize***, and adding the
***28 bytes of header size***, you can quickly and precisely calculate
the total size of an event packet.

### Ordering

Event packets must be ordered in such a way to guarantee timestamp
monotonicity. This means that for all packets of a same type and source,
the timestamps must always be monotonically increasing. Further, between
packets of different types belonging to the same source, the main
timestamp of the first event decides the order in which packets should
be written. If this timestamp is equal between different packets, they
can be ordered by increasing event type ID, but this is not a
requirement, only a suggestion.

Timestamp monotonicity does not need to be guaranteed globally between
multiple sources, as any one of them can operate on different
time-scales. No order is enforced between sources.

While this ordering requires some additional processing when writing, it
greatly simplifies reading, since one always just has to read up to the
next packet with a greater first timestamp than whatever timestamp one
is interested in, and is guaranteed to have seen all relevant packets
with events up to that point.

The **FRAME\_EVENT** packet type has four timestamps defined. Of these,
"End of Frame" is considered the main timestamp for the purpose of
ordering. More generically, the timestamp that is indicated by the
**'eventTSOffset'** header field is the one relevant for ordering.

If timestamp reset events occur during a recording (because of device
synchronisation or manual reset), then packet timestamp order is no
longer monotonic as subsequent timestamps start again from zero. A
timestamp reset event of type **SPECIAL\_EVENT** will indicate such a
reset clearly.

Events
------

The first 100 event type IDs are reserved for expansion of this format.
If you create event types within a private distribution, we recommend
that you number them from 100 upwards.

The following event types are supported by default:

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| **Event ID**          | **Event**             | **Description**       |
+=======================+=======================+=======================+
| 0                     | SPECIAL\_EVENT        | Encodes special       |

Further, the first bit (bit 0) of the first byte of any event is
reserved to be a validity bit. This bit is used to mark whether an event
is still valid or not, and can be used to efficiently filter out events
from a packet. '0' in the 0th bit of the first byte means invalid, '1'
means valid. This way zeroing-out an event packet sets all its events to
invalid. Care must be taken to put the field containing the validity
mark always as the first member of an event.

Also, to generate the full 64 bit timestamp, which doesn't suffer from
wrap-around problems, the packet-level 32 bit timestamp
(***eventTSOverflow***) and the event-level 32 bit timestamp have to be
composed as follows:

> **fullTS = (packet.eventTSOverflow \<\< 31) \| event.timestamp**

(The shift is of 31 bits rather than 32 because of the signed
representation).

The various event types and their precise encoding are described in the
following sections.

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+

A frame is considered to be one event - a "frame event". A frame packet
may contain 1 or more frame events. Multiplying **eventSize** by
**eventCapacity** still gives the length of the data portion of the
packet in bytes.

The Frame event is slightly different in that it doesn't have a
constant, fixed size across all events, due to the pixel data which may
vary due to ROI readouts or different resolutions.

Within a Frame event packet, all Frame events do have the same, constant
size, as given by the **eventSize** field in the event packet header.
This is as expected and follows the usual scheme.

As such, it's a simple matter to look at the ***eventSize*** field of a
Frame event packet's header to figure out the exact size of a Frame
event for that particular packet, and thus where each Frame event
begins.

Within a Frame event, only pixels up to ('X length' \* 'Y length' \*
'Channel number') can be accessed with the expectation of having valid
values. There might be more pixels than that, determined by how much
memory was allocated for the Frame event, but those will all be zero, if
they do exist.

Frame Events can directly be used with standard libraries such as
OpenCV. For example the following code can be used to generate an OpenCV
Mat '**frameMat**' from a Frame Event '**f**', sharing the same pixel
array memory:

***Size frameSize(caerFrameEventGetLengthX(f),
caerFrameEventGetLengthY(f));***

***Mat frameMat(frameSize,
CV\_16UC(caerFrameEventGetChannelNumber(f)),***

> ***caerFrameEventGetPixelArrayUnsafe(f));***

### IMU 6-axes Event

The X, Y and Z axes are referred to the camera plane. X increases to the
right, Y going up and Z towards where the lens is pointing. Rotation for
the gyroscope is counter-clockwise along the increasing axis, for all
three axes.

Formats
-------

Here the specifics about the event packet encoding formats, as given by
the Format header line:

### RAW (ID=0x00)

A direct dump of the memory holding an event packet. No processing is
needed at input, allocating the right amount of memory and reading the
bytes into it directly is sufficient.

### SerializedTS (ID=0x01)

TODO: will serialize special, polarity, sample, ear event timestamps,
since often the same timestamp is valid for many events, especially with
serial AER or external input events.

### PNGFrames (ID=0x02)

TODO: compress image data of frame events with lossless PNG.

TODO: will use LZ4 compression to save space. One event packet is one
LZ4 frame.

AEDAT 3.0
=========

This section explains how version 3.0 differed from version 3.1.

Header Lines
------------

-   The version header line reads as follows:

'**\#!AER-DAT3.0\\r\\n**'

-   There is no end of header line required. The only way therefore to
    > check where the header ends is to check that a line starts with
    > the '**\#**' character and then read the line up to the new-line
    > marker, but this can fail if the very first byte of the first
    > event also happens to have a value of 35 (decimal), corresponding
    > to the '**\#**' character.

Polarity Event
--------------

The origin point is in the lower left of the screen rather than the
upper left, meaning that it is not compatible with the standard computer
graphics way of doing things e.g. libraries such as OpenCV.

Frame Event
-----------

The origin point is in the lower left of the screen rather than the
upper left, meaning that it is not compatible with the standard computer
graphics way of doing things e.g. libraries such as OpenCV.

The color filter enumeration values are different, due in part to a
smaller available range; the ROI identifier is thus positioned
differently. Both features were never in active use for AEDAT 3.0:

  **Point1D**
  -------------
  **Point2D**
  **Point3D**
  **Point4D**
  **Spike**

Network Streaming
=================

Streaming data over the network, instead of to a file, is done with
exactly the same data formats.

The only difference is that with streaming, no [[headers as defined
above]{.underline}](#common-version-header) are sent, meaning that
receivers need software switches to understand what they are receiving
and how to interpret it. In jAER, for versions 1.0 and 2.0, those can be
found in the network streaming dialogs, as well as by selecting the
appropriate AEChip class manually for data parsing.

Version 3.X on the other hand attempts to automate this by sending a 20
bytes network header that signals the presence of version 3.X data with
a magic number at the start.

For stream based protocols, like TCP, this header will be sent once at
the start of the stream.

For message-based network communication, for example UDP, this header
will be part of each message, at the front, to ensure it can be properly
parsed always.

All header fields/integers are little-endian!

The 20 bytes network header format is the following:
