This guide describes cAER installation and how to stream event data via
network. We assume you have a Linux or MacOS X system.

## What is cAER?

cAER is an efficient embedded C framework for processing event-based
sensor data from iniLabs sensors. It can run on hardware ranging from
Raspberry Pi to ODroid to laptop or desktop PCs. It is licensed under
the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) v2.1.

See [this iniLabs software
comparison](https://inivation.com/support/software/) for
more information about different software frameworks and libraries that
are available to interact with neuromorphic devices.

cAER is described in [this technical
report](https://github.com/inilabs/caer/blob/master/docs/caer.pdf)
(an older version) and [these
slides](https://github.com/inilabs/caer/blob/master/docs/cAER_pres_04.11.2015.pdf).

cAER uses the [low-level libcaer library
API](http://inivation.com/support/libcaer/) to communicate
with devices.

This guide is still under development, please refer to the README files
included with the cAER software. For Windows installations, see
README.Windows.
